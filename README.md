# I4C_MobileApp
Repository to place all the app source code

Prep
- Download GitHub
- Clone the repository -> it should appear as a folder in your pc as "I4C_MobileApp"
  - The cloning link is on the right ------> 

Instructions to upload to GitHub
- Add file: puts it on a 'waiting list'
- Commit: a short message telling the others what changes you've made
- Push: Upload to the repository

IMPORTANT NOTE
- Before making any changes: Pull from the repository to get the latest changes otherwise we'll have to go through the pain-staking task of conflict resolution...
  - If you don't pull, you'll have a different version to everyone else

Once you've mastered GitHub:
- You can investigate something called a branch which is used for experimental code.
  - It's completely isolated from the main repository (which is called the 'master branch')
    - So, if you break stuff, it won't affect the code in the master branch :)
  - If your experimental code works and you would like to be part of the main code, we'll have to 'merge' the branches
- View previous commits (dunno if this would be considered hard though...)
  - Previous versions can be seen and can be compared
